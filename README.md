# Ethereum-Fetcher
Ethereum Fetcher is designed to allow users to easily retrieve information about a specific Ethereum address, such as their transaction history and account balance. This information is displayed in a user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to access and understand if a user inputs valid address.

The application is able to:
- Crawl and visualize all transaction data from an address the user inputs
- It retrieves information about wallets (addresses) transactions, as well as amounts of ETH associated with transactions made to and from the given wallet W and
show them in a simple human-readable way, from a GUI made in Tkinter.

- I used Visual Studio Code environment to create this Python app, I commented parts of my code in Serbian language (because first part of the interview was in Serbia with Ms Marija Krivosic)
